LandingZone is an entry to the Kivy 2012 programming contest.

- Before starting this contest I didn't know anything about Kivy or Python, so there should be some ugly coding in there ;) 

- This is a very experimental game concept : try to land the different shapes on the target area by taping on the different 'engines' (an arrow indicates the direction of the thrust)

- Physics engine is broken, no doubt about that ;(

- Will not play well outside of the 800x600 resolution

- Plays best on multi-touch screen (although it doesn't display correctly on my android tablet).
